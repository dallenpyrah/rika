# goal.md — Rika must be indistinguishable from Amp

## 0. North star

**A user dropped into Rika must not be able to tell it apart from Amp.** Same
startup screen, same chrome, same colors, same spacing, same keybindings, same
tool-call rendering, same expand/collapse behavior, same thread switching, same
streaming feel, same error surfaces, same copy/wording — pixel-for-pixel and
keystroke-for-keystroke. The only acceptable visible differences are the four
deliberate upgrades in §3.

"Looks basically like Amp" is a **failure**. The bar is: screenshot Rika,
screenshot Amp, diff them, and a stranger cannot say which is which.

Think of Rika as **Amp 3.0**: identical product surface, rebuilt on Effect +
OpenTUI + Rivet first principles so we can go further later.

## 1. Hard rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Library-first, always.** Before writing *any* custom code, you MUST check,
   in order:
   - **Effect** (`effect`, `@effect/*`) — streams, fibers, schedules, queues,
     refs, layers, schema, platform. Almost all concurrency/state/IO primitives
     already exist here.
   - **OpenTUI** (`@opentui/core`) — rendering, layout, input, buffers,
     scrollback, styling, surfaces. Do not hand-roll a renderer, a layout
     engine, an input parser, or an ANSI writer if OpenTUI has it.
   - **Rivet** (`rivetkit`, `@rivetkit/effect`) — actor lifecycle, durability,
     remote transport, multi-client fan-out.
   - **Drizzle** (persistence package only) — storage/migrations.

   Only if the capability genuinely does not exist in those libraries may you
   write it yourself — and then you write a one-line note in the relevant
   `AGENTS.md`/`CONTEXT.md` explaining why it had to be custom.

2. **No code comments.** Rationale goes in `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, or
   `.agents/skills/`. (See repo memory: keep code comment-free.)

3. **Effect-native only.** Services, layers, typed errors (`Schema.TaggedError`),
   scopes, streams, fibers. No ad-hoc promises, no module-level singletons, no
   `setTimeout` soup. Follow the OpenCode-style module shape already used in the
   repo (`export * as Module`, `Interface`, `Context.Service`, explicit `Layer`).

4. **Parity is verified, never assumed.** Every parity claim in this file and in
   `docs/parity/AMP_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` must point at evidence: a side-by-side
   screenshot pair or a recording in `docs/parity/`. No evidence ⇒ status is
   `unverified`, not `done`.

5. **Never break existing behavior.** This is a port, not a rewrite of product
   decisions. If you would change what the user sees or how a command behaves,
   stop — unless it is one of the §3 upgrades.

## 2. Non-functional requirements (these are requirements, not aspirations)

| Property | Requirement | How to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scroll-while-streaming | The user can scroll up/down through transcript **while tokens are still streaming**, and the viewport does NOT get yanked back to the bottom. Auto-follow resumes only when the user scrolls back to the bottom. | Start a long streaming turn, scroll up mid-stream, confirm position holds; record it. |
| Streaming smoothness | No visible flicker, no full-screen repaint per token, no tearing. Render deltas, not whole frames. Prefer OpenTUI's diffing/buffer APIs over reprinting. | Screen-record a fast stream in Rika and Amp; compare frame stability. |
| Memory footprint | Stays low and flat over a long thread. No unbounded transcript array growth that re-renders in full. Transcript/scrollback must be bounded or virtualized. | Run a long session; watch RSS. It must not grow without bound. |
| Input latency | Keystroke-to-echo and scroll responsiveness indistinguishable from Amp. No input lag during streaming. | Type/scroll during a heavy stream; compare feel. |
| Startup time | Cold start to interactive prompt comparable to Amp. | Time `rika` vs `amp` to first prompt. |
| Subagents | Subagents are set up the way Amp does them (see §4) — not the current bounded read-only stub. | Trigger a subagent task in both; compare behavior and rendering. |

## 3. The ONLY deliberate differences from Amp

Everything else is a 1:1 port. These four are intentional upgrades and must
still feel native (same UI affordances, same result rendering as the Amp tool
they replace):

1. **Semantic search** as a built-in retrieval tool.
2. **AST-grep outline** as a built-in code-structure tool.
3. **fff** instead of ripgrep for fast file/content find.
4. **Subagents done correctly** — proper Amp-style subagent orchestration
   (independent context windows, parallel fan-out, final-summary return), not a
   degraded stub.

If any of these changes *how a result looks* in the transcript versus Amp's
equivalent, that is a parity bug — the upgrade is in the engine, not the chrome.

## 4. Subagent parity spec (current gap)

Amp's model (from the owner's manual):
- Subagents have their **own context window** and their own tools (file edit,
  terminal, etc.).
- Used for multi-step tasks that split into independent parts, large-output
  operations, and parallel work across code areas.
- They run in **isolation**: cannot talk to each other, cannot be steered
  mid-task, start fresh without the parent's accumulated context, and the main
  agent receives only their **final summary**.
- Spawned automatically for suitable tasks (mostly `smart` mode) and can be
  encouraged by the user mentioning subagents / parallel work.

Rika today (`packages/agent/src/subagent-runtime.ts`) is a "read-only bounded"
runtime. Parity work: bring it to the Amp model above (own context, own tools,
parallel fan-out, final-summary return, auto-spawn heuristics), and render
subagent activity in the transcript the way Amp does (the `subagent` card kind
already exists in `packages/tui/src/view-state.ts`).

## 5. The comparison workflow (do this every iteration)

You have computer-use MCP tools (`mcp__computer-use__*`). Use them to behave like
a real engineer using each tool, then diff.

### 5.1 Access & setup
1. Load the whole computer-use toolkit in one shot:
   `ToolSearch { query: "computer-use", max_results: 30 }`.
2. `request_access` for **Ghostty** (the terminal we test in) and any app you
   need. Re-request if you discover you need another app mid-task.
3. Terminals are granted at tier **"click"**: you can screenshot and left-click,
   but you CANNOT type into them or send keypresses via computer-use. So:
   - Drive Rika/Amp by launching them from the **Bash tool**, not by typing in
     Ghostty through computer-use.
   - Use computer-use for **observation** (screenshots, scroll, recordings) and
     for **clicks** (e.g. clicking a tool call to expand it) where clicking is
     the thing under test.
   - For prompts/keystrokes that must go into the TUI, prefer non-interactive
     paths (`rika -x`, stream-json) or scripted input, and document any step
     that genuinely needs manual keyboard input.

### 5.2 The loop (repeat until indistinguishable)
For each surface/behavior in the §6 checklist:
1. **Capture Amp** — open Amp in Ghostty, drive it to the exact state, take a
   screenshot (and a screen recording for anything animated: streaming, scroll,
   expand/collapse, thread switch). Save under `docs/parity/screenshots/amp/`
   and `docs/parity/recordings/amp/`.
2. **Capture Rika** — drive Rika to the *same* state, capture the same way into
   the `…/rika/` folders.
3. **Diff** — put the two side by side. Look at: glyphs, box-drawing chars,
   colors/dim/bold, padding, indentation, alignment, spinner frames, label
   wording, timestamps, truncation, empty/error states, cursor shape, status
   line, footer hints. Zoom in (`mcp__computer-use__zoom`) on anything subtle.
4. **Log it** — add/update a row in `docs/parity/SCREENSHOT_LOG.md` with the file
   names, the verdict (match / mismatch), and the specific pixel/behavior delta.
5. **Fix** — make the smallest Effect/OpenTUI change that closes the delta
   (library-first per §1). Re-capture. Do not mark a row `match` without a fresh
   side-by-side pair proving it.
6. **Be relentless.** Keep iterating per surface until a stranger can't tell.
   One-pixel misalignment, one wrong dim level, one different word = not done.

### 5.3 Evidence naming
`docs/parity/screenshots/{amp,rika}/<surface>-<state>-<NN>.png`
`docs/parity/recordings/{amp,rika}/<surface>-<behavior>-<NN>.<ext>`
e.g. `amp/startup-empty-01.png` ⇄ `rika/startup-empty-01.png`.

## 6. Parity checklist (the nitpicky list — capture evidence for each)

Status legend: `unverified` (no side-by-side yet) · `mismatch` (captured, differs) · `match` (captured, indistinguishable).

### 6.1 Startup & chrome
- [ ] Startup/splash screen: logo/wordmark, version line, tips, model/mode line — exact layout, spacing, color. (`unverified`)
- [ ] Empty-state prompt area, placeholder text, footer hint line. (`unverified`)
- [ ] Status line: mode (`deep`/`smart`/`rush`), model name, reasoning effort, fast-mode indicator, git branch, cost display. (`unverified`)
- [ ] Cursor shape/blink, prompt prefix glyph. (`unverified`)

### 6.2 Streaming & transcript
- [ ] Assistant token streaming: cadence, wrapping, no flicker. (`unverified`)
- [ ] Thinking/reasoning block rendering and its expand/collapse (Alt+T). (`unverified`)
- [ ] Spinner frames and placement match Amp exactly (current Rika frames: `⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏` — confirm vs Amp). (`unverified`)
- [ ] Scroll up/down **while streaming** without snap-to-bottom; auto-follow resumes at bottom. (`unverified`)

### 6.3 Tool calls
- [ ] Collapsed tool-call card: glyph, name, one-line summary, status color (info/running/success/error). (`unverified`)
- [ ] **Click to expand / collapse** a tool call shows full input/output; click again collapses. Verify with computer-use click + screenshot both states. (`unverified`)
- [ ] Keyboard expand/collapse parity (`Alt+T`, focus prev/next) matches Amp. (`unverified`)
- [ ] `detailsExpandedByDefault` behavior matches Amp's setting semantics. (`unverified`)
- [ ] Diff/edit tool rendering (added/removed line colors, file header). (`unverified`)
- [ ] Error tool result rendering. (`unverified`)

### 6.4 Threads
- [ ] Thread switching: how the list looks, how switching animates/redraws, transcript reload. Record it. (`unverified`)
- [ ] New thread / archive thread flows and their key chords (`Ctrl+C Ctrl+N`, archive). (`unverified`)
- [ ] Thread reference (`@@` search) and file mention (`@`) pickers. (`unverified`)

### 6.5 Command palette & keybindings
- [ ] `Ctrl+O` command palette: layout, filtering, categories, item wording. (`unverified`)
- [ ] Full keymap parity vs `amp config keymap` (modes `Ctrl+S`, history `Ctrl+R`, editor `Ctrl+G`, reasoning `Alt+D`, fast `Alt+R`, etc.). (`unverified`)
- [ ] Message queueing (Enter Enter steer, Esc Esc interrupt) and edit-prior-message (Tab → e). (`unverified`)

### 6.6 Wording & misc
- [ ] All user-facing strings, notices, and error copy match Amp's wording. (`unverified`)
- [ ] Image paste affordance, `@file` mention, cost line format. (`unverified`)

## 7. Definition of done

A surface is **done** only when ALL hold:
1. Side-by-side Amp/Rika evidence exists in `docs/parity/` and is linked from
   `docs/parity/SCREENSHOT_LOG.md`.
2. The verdict is `match` and the delta column is empty.
3. The relevant §2 non-functional requirements still pass for that surface.
4. No new code comments; any custom code is justified by §1.

The **project** is done when every §6 row and every applicable row in the
feature inventory is `match`, the four §3 upgrades work without altering chrome,
and a blind side-by-side test is a coin flip.

## 8. Companion living documents
- `docs/parity/AMP_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` — every Amp feature, mapped to its Rika
  location and parity status. Keep it current as features are verified.
- `docs/parity/SCREENSHOT_LOG.md` — the running log of every screenshot/recording
  pair and its verdict. Append to it every iteration; never delete history.
- `docs/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` — existing higher-level Amp-parity matrix.
