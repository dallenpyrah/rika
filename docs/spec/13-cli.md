# Effect CLI and Automation

## Command Architecture

Every argument-bearing command or script uses `effect/unstable/cli` `Command`, `Flag`, and `Argument`. Leaf command modules export command values. The root CLI module exports the command tree and a `run(argv)` helper built with `Command.runWith`. The app entrypoint alone defines `main` with `Command.run` and interprets it with Bun runtime and platform layers.

Business behavior lives behind Effect services. Flags and arguments are Schema-validated. Standard output, standard error, terminal access, and filesystem behavior use Effect platform services.

Help, version, completions, and parse errors require only platform services. They must not initialize SQL, Relay, models, MCP, plugins, or OpenTUI.

## Required Surfaces

- Default interactive TUI.
- `run` and `-x` execute modes.
- Stream JSON and multi-message JSONL.
- Threads, config, keymap, tools, skills, MCP, review, doctor, version, and update.

## Stable Contract

Flags, help, exit codes, stdout, stderr, and JSON records are public CLI contracts. Tests invoke `run(argv)` without process spawning and package smoke tests exercise the built binary.

`config list` and `doctor` report the effective global/workspace model route and credential presence. They never print credential values; persisted configuration cannot contain model API keys.

## Flag Relationships

- Root stream flags require `--execute`.
- `--stream-json-input` requires `--stream-json`.
- `--stream-json-thinking` requires `--stream-json`.
- `threads continue` accepts either `--last` or exactly one thread id, never both. It opens the interactive TUI with that Thread selected and its durable history replayed. Noninteractive transcript inspection uses `threads export --format json`.
- `mcp add` accepts exactly one remote `--url` or one local command with arguments.
- Expected validation failures write one concise stderr message and exit with code 2.
