# Non-Functional Requirements

## Correctness

- Durable side effects use stable idempotency keys.
- Cursor replay is monotonic and duplicate-safe.
- Failed dependencies produce typed failures rather than silent fallback.
- Configuration and persisted values are Schema-decoded at boundaries.

## Local Operation

- SQLite is the only required database.
- No daemon, Docker, Postgres, Rivet engine, or hosted Rika service is required.
- The packaged artifact restores the terminal immediately and exactly once on success, failure, defect, signal, interruption, renderer initialization failure, and cleanup-step failure, before awaiting slower client cleanup.

## Performance

- Input remains responsive during streaming and tool execution.
- Render work is frame-bounded and does not block durable event consumption.
- Tool output and model context are bounded.
- Parallel work has explicit concurrency limits.
- Opening a Thread loads at most fifty transcript entries before the first interactive frame.
- The TUI mounts at most two hundred transcript entries, including overscan, regardless of durable history size.
- A live delta changes only its keyed transcript entry and fixed chrome. It never walks or recreates the complete transcript.
- Renderer updates are coalesced to at most one normal frame per sixteen milliseconds. Terminal results, permission requests, and resync frames bypass that delay.
- Resident interactive delivery uses bounded queues. A slow consumer receives a typed resync requirement rather than unbounded buffered history.
- The transcript benchmark covers 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 Turns. Input dispatch and a one-entry live patch stay under sixteen milliseconds at p95 on the supported packaged development target, and mounted renderable count stays constant after the window is full.

## Maintainability

- Baton and Relay are external dependencies used only through public exports.
- Every behavior-bearing service has a test or memory layer.
- Public behavior is specified before implementation.
- Feature completion requires real-flow evidence.
