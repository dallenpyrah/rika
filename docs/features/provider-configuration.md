# Provider connection configuration

Settings may override the built-in `openai` and `anthropic` HTTP connections with `baseUrl` and `apiKeyEnv`, and the built-in `bedrock` connection with non-secret AWS identity fields. A workspace provider entry replaces the matching global provider entry as a unit; omitted values fall back to the built-in connection, not fields from the global override.

`baseUrl` must be an absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL without embedded credentials, and `apiKeyEnv` must name an uppercase environment variable. Literal keys, tokens, protocols, and custom providers are rejected; credentials are read from the named environment variable and configuration output reports only whether they are present.

Bedrock uses Baton's AWS default credential chain, including environment, shared profiles, SSO, roles, web identity, ECS, and EC2 metadata. Bearer mode uses `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`. In default auth mode, an optional structured `authRefresh` command is run only after Baton classifies an eligible credential rejection; its argv is never persisted or displayed. The command cannot modify Rika's environment, so it should update a shared credential cache, as `aws sso login` does.
