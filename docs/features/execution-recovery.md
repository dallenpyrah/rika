# Execution recovery

On startup and reopen, Rika reconciles nonterminal Turns and stale read state against Relay. It inspects the durable Execution, backfills bounded event pages, then follows from the newest stored cursor; applying an event and advancing the projection checkpoint is idempotent.

Following stops at a Relay terminal event or an actionable permission request. Missing or interrupted transport never invents completion, and stale local terminal updates cannot replace a known terminal result. A disposable projection or Thread summary may be rebuilt from Relay after loss or mismatch.
