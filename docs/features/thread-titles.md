# Automatic Thread titles

A new interactive Thread starts with a temporary title derived from its first prompt. After the first Turn completes, Rika asks the pinned title route for a concise title, stores up to eighty characters, and updates the open terminal and Thread summaries.

Title generation uses a separate durable Execution and never changes the completed Turn. An unavailable route, failed request, or empty response leaves the existing title in place.
