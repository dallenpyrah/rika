# Rika Feature Inventory

This is the canonical product feature ledger. It distinguishes Amp behavior, Rika v1 behavior, Rika v2 intent, implementation status, owning specification, and proof.

Status values:

- `planned`: included but not implemented.
- `framework-blocked`: included but awaiting a published Baton or Relay capability.
- `implementing`: active implementation exists but is not fully verified.
- `implemented`: code exists and local tests pass.
- `verified`: the real packaged flow and parity evidence pass.
- `excluded`: deliberately outside Rika v2.
- `deferred`: not required for initial completion but compatible with the architecture.

## Built-In Tools

Catalog completeness is enforced by `bun run catalog:evidence`: all 18 entries in `Catalog.definitions` map to either the 29-test standard durable transcript matrix or the 3-test specialty transcript matrix. Both matrices also assert completeness for their respective catalog partitions.
