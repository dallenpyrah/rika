# Threads and Turns

A Thread is Rika's durable user-facing conversation and work record in one Workspace. It carries its Workspace, title, labels, pin and archive state. A Turn is one user instruction and its top-level Execution; it stores the prompt and structured attachments, lifecycle state, pinned execution route and extension context, and the latest known Relay cursor.

Rika owns Thread and Turn records. A Turn moves through `accepted`, `queued`, `running`, `waiting`, and one of `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`; terminal state is not replaced by a stale update. Queued instructions are Pending Turns and do not appear in the transcript until their Execution starts.
