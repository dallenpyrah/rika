# Remote Rivet Hosting

Rika uses one `ThreadActor` contract for both local development and remote hosting. Deployment mode is a layer/configuration choice, not a different actor API.

## Current status

Rivet remains a parallel adapter while orbs use the RemoteControl HTTP+NDJSON API as their client contract. This note is the controlling status for orb work. See [ADR 0001](adr/0001-orb-contract-defer-rivet.md).

- `packages/rivet-host/src/thread-actor.ts` defines the actor contract.
- `packages/rivet-host/src/thread-live.ts` implements the server-side actor with Effect services.
- `packages/rivet-host/src/thread-client.ts` calls the same actor contract through `@rivetkit/effect` clients.
- `packages/rivet-host/src/host-config.ts` resolves local vs remote Rivet configuration and converts it to official Rivet registry/client options.
- `LocalHost.threadClientLayer(...)` gives other packages the typed ThreadActor client without importing Rivet internals directly.

## Configuration

| Variable                                   | Meaning                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RIKA_RIVET_HOST=local`                    | Default. Use a local Rivet endpoint.                                      |
| `RIKA_RIVET_HOST=remote`                   | Require an explicit remote endpoint.                                      |
| `RIKA_RIVET_ENDPOINT` / `RIVET_ENDPOINT`   | Rivet registry/client endpoint. Local default is `http://127.0.0.1:6420`. |
| `RIKA_RIVET_TOKEN` / `RIVET_TOKEN`         | Optional remote Rivet auth token.                                         |
| `RIKA_RIVET_NAMESPACE` / `RIVET_NAMESPACE` | Optional remote namespace.                                                |
| `RIKA_RIVET_NO_WELCOME=0`                  | Allows the Rivet welcome output for local debugging.                      |
| `RIVET_RUNNER_VERSION`                     | Optional deploy/build marker for remote runner selection.                 |

Local development starts the local actor host with:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/rivet-host dev
```

Remote mode should set `RIKA_RIVET_HOST=remote` and the endpoint/token/namespace required by the target Rivet environment. The API server and actor host may run in the same process for local development, but hosted deployments should treat them as separate adapters over the same persistence services.

## Workspace access model

Remote requests carry an optional `user_id`. The bearer token gates the remote-control API; `user_id` is attribution and presence identity, not authorization.

- Remote-control adapters pass identity through shared schema request payloads for event attribution and turn-conflict display.
- Presence heartbeats use `user_id` in an in-memory map and never persist it as membership proof.
- `owner` members may perform future hosted `admin` actions; `owner` and `member` remain the durable membership roles.
- The first identified user to create an empty workspace is recorded as the `owner`.
- Hosted access control must use bearer/session credentials and durable membership data, not a self-asserted `user_id` field by itself.

## Persistence and recovery

The event log remains the canonical durable source of truth in both local and remote mode:

- `ThreadEventLog` stores append-only thread facts.
- `ThreadProjection` stores rebuildable thread summaries for listing and access decisions.
- `WorkspaceStore` stores durable workspace memberships in `workspace_memberships`.
- Actor hot state is disposable and must be rebuilt from the event log by replay.

Hosted operators should:

1. Apply committed Drizzle migrations before serving traffic: `bun run db:migrate`.
2. Back up the SQLite database file or managed SQLite volume before each deployment.
3. Treat projection corruption as recoverable: rebuild projections from `thread_events` rather than editing actor state.
4. Treat membership corruption as security-sensitive: restore `workspace_memberships` from backup before enabling hosted access.
5. Roll actor workers by versioned deployment; actors can replay from the event log after restart.

## Security boundaries

- Local workspace file access remains local to the process that owns the workspace root.
- Remote clients steer threads through the remote-control API; they do not receive raw filesystem access by default.
- Raw Rivet imports stay in `@rika/rivet-host`.
- Raw Drizzle handles stay in `@rika/persistence`.
- Hosted user authorization stays in `WorkspaceAccess`; server and actor code only adapt request identity into that service.
