# Launch Checklist

Issue #30 is the first launch hardening pass. This checklist records what is ready, how it is verified, and what is intentionally not done yet.

## Verification matrix

| Gate          | Command                 | Purpose                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Format        | `bun run format:check`  | Repository formatting.                               |
| Lint          | `bun run lint`          | Oxlint repository lint.                              |
| Typecheck     | `bun run typecheck`     | Package TypeScript contracts through Turbo.          |
| Tests         | `bun run test`          | Unit/integration tests across packages.              |
| Build         | `bun run build`         | Package build graph.                                 |
| Docs          | `bun run docs:check`    | Required docs/scripts/guidance exist.                |
| Migrations    | `bun run db:migrate`    | Committed Drizzle migrations apply locally.          |
| Release smoke | `bun run package:smoke` | Compiled CLI starts, prints help, and runs `doctor`. |

CI runs the same launch gates except local database migration; migrations are covered by package tests and the explicit local gate.

## Amp-parity checklist

## Known launch non-goals

- No hosted billing/pricing system.
- No telemetry upload by default.
- No plugin sandbox isolation yet; plugins are trusted local code.
- No App Store/Homebrew/npm distribution yet; first launch uses source/compiled artifacts.
- No fully featured IDE extension packages yet; the shared protocol and CLI helpers are ready.
- No legal terms beyond repository usage notes; add formal terms before public SaaS launch.

## Release steps

1. Pull main and install dependencies: `bun install`.
2. Run the full verification matrix.
3. Build release artifact: `bun run package`.
4. Smoke compiled artifact: `bun run package:smoke`.
5. Install/update local binary: `bun run install:local`.
6. Start local use: `rika doctor`, then `rika` or `rika --execute "..."`.
