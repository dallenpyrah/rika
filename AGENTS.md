# Rika

## Purpose

Rika is a greenfield Effect-native coding agent system. The repository is a Bun/Turbo monorepo that grows through the stacked GitHub issues.

## Conventions

Do not put comments in code (no inline `//`, no JSDoc `/** */`, no block comments). Put design rationale, conventions, and context in AGENTS.md files, in `CONTEXT.md`, or in skill files under `.agents/skills/`.

## Greenfield Change Policy

- Rika is greenfield. There are no production users, no public compatibility contract, and no legacy behavior to preserve by default.
- Prefer a breaking change when it makes the system more correct, simpler, more explicit, or easier to operate.
- Do not add compatibility aliases, migration shims, fallback config keys, deprecated code paths, or legacy mode names unless the user explicitly asks for them or durable data safety requires them.
- When renaming an API, config key, schema field, mode, command, file path, or domain concept, update all known call sites, tests, docs, and examples in the same change instead of supporting both names.
- Delete obsolete code, tests, fixtures, docs, and branches of behavior once the replacement exists.
- Breakage is acceptable when intentional and verified. Silent compatibility layers are the thing to avoid.

## Current Standards

- The product name is Rika. Do not use Orika or resurrect old project assumptions.
- Keep Rika fully Effect-native: use Effect services, layers, schemas, typed errors, scopes, streams, and fibers instead of ad hoc promises or singletons.
- Follow OpenCode-style module shape: `export * as Module from "./module"`, an exported `Interface`, a `Context.Service` class, and one or more explicit `Layer` values.
- Use `Schema.TaggedErrorClass` for errors that cross service boundaries.
- Use `Effect.fn("Module.method")` for service methods and named workflows; these spans export to motel automatically when telemetry is on.
- Log through the single `Diagnostics` sink using the wide-events pattern (`Diagnostics.event`), one rich event per operation. Never use `console.*` or `Effect.log*`. See `docs/observability.md` and `.agents/skills/effect-logging/SKILL.md`.
- Bind services to named variables in `Effect.gen` before calling methods; do not use nested service yields.
- Keep infrastructure swappable. Runtime code depends on service interfaces; tests provide in-memory or fake layers.
- Package tests live under `test/` and mirror the relative `src/` path for the module under test.
- Use Bun as the runtime/package manager, Turbo for monorepo task orchestration, and oxlint for linting once the scaffold exists.
- Use Drizzle only behind persistence services. Raw Drizzle handles do not cross into CLI, TUI, LLM, or actor orchestration modules.
- Treat the append-only event log as canonical durable truth. Projections and actor state are rebuildable.
- Use Rivet actors from day one for active thread orchestration. Keep Rivet-specific code in the Rivet host layer.
- Make `fff`, hashline read/edit, semantic search, and ast-grep outline default built-in tools.
- Keep tool permissions centralized through `PermissionPolicy.Service`; Rika's default product policy is allow-all unless configuration or plugin hooks override it.
- Keep implementation simple. Do not add abstractions unless they make dependencies swappable, remove real duplication, or match the established OpenCode-style shape.

## For AI Agents

- Read `CONTEXT.md` before naming new domain concepts.
- Read `docs/RESEARCH.md` before changing the architecture or issue stack.
- Read `docs/effect-module-conventions.md` before adding or changing an Effect service.
- Read `docs/runtime-and-layers.md` before adding process runtime assembly or base services.
- Read `docs/persistence.md` before changing Drizzle schema, migrations, or persistence services.
- When a task matches a project-local skill, read the skill file under `.agents/skills/` before acting.
- Do not create runtime packages outside the planned Bun/Turbo workspace structure without updating the repo guidance.
- Do not place product/domain definitions in `AGENTS.md`; put resolved vocabulary in `CONTEXT.md`.
- Do not bypass Effect with module-level mutable state for services that must be testable.
- Do not call Drizzle, Rivet, model providers, or filesystem mutation APIs directly from UI-facing modules.

## Testing And Verification

- `bun install`: install workspace dependencies and update `bun.lock`.
- `bun run db:generate`: generate Drizzle SQL migrations from the persistence schema.
- `bun run db:migrate`: apply committed Drizzle migrations to the configured local SQLite database.
- `bun run docs:check`: verify documented scripts and guidance files still exist.
- `bun run lint`: run oxlint across the repository.
- `bun run typecheck`: run package type checks through Turbo.
- `bun run test`: run package tests through Turbo.
- `bun run build`: build package entrypoints through Turbo.
- `bun run format:check`: check formatting with Prettier.
- `bun run package:smoke`: compile the CLI release artifact and verify help/doctor startup.
