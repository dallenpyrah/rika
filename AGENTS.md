# Rika

Rika is a local coding-agent CLI and OpenTUI app written in Effect TypeScript. Read `PRODUCT.md` for direction and `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary and ownership.

## Boundaries

- Relay owns durable execution; Baton owns the agent loop; Rika owns product semantics and projections.
- Use released Baton, Relay, Effect, and OpenTUI package exports. Never edit, import from, format, build, or test `repos/*`.
- Use Effect services, schemas, streams, scopes, typed errors, platform APIs, and structured concurrency. Keep raw Promise or host APIs in a named outer adapter only when Effect has no equivalent.
- Run Effects only at app, process, test-host, or framework boundaries. Keep pure computations pure.
- Build CLI surfaces with `effect/unstable/cli`, use Effect SQL for Rika SQLite state, use WebSockets for Rika process transport, and keep OpenTUI imports in the TUI adapter.
- Do not add direct provider SDKs, Rivet, actors, web or IDE clients, remote runners, orbs, semantic code search, or ast-grep outline tools.
- Do not create catch-all `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, or `lib` modules. Do not put comments in code.

## Documentation

- `PRODUCT.md` owns audience, direction, and exclusions. It never lists features or status.
- `CONTEXT.md` owns vocabulary, authority, and framework boundaries.
- `docs/features/<capability>.md` owns one current capability contract. Keep it short and merge overlap into the owning capability.
- `docs/decisions/<slug>.md` records only a lasting choice and why. `docs/tradeoffs/<slug>.md` records only a meaningful gain, cost, and rejected options.
- Do not create documentation indexes, ledgers, status or evidence tables, numbered specs, decision-record metadata, plans, history sections, related-link sections, or Markdown meaning/structure validators.
- `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, and `ISSUES.md` may track unfinished work but never define architecture or product behavior.

## Scripts and verification

- Root everyday scripts are `build`, `check`, `dev`, `format`, `test`, and `typecheck`. Plain package, migration, release, and install workflows are allowed.
- Do not add colon-named aliases, dispatchers that hide old aliases, or wrappers for Git, Docker, status, logs, watch, coverage, vendor, or upstream commands.
- Use `bun run package -- --target <target>` for target packaging.
- Use `@effect/vitest` for Effect behavior. Use `bun:test` only for Bun-native or packaged-process integration.
- Run focused tests while working, then `bun run check` when the risk and time budget permit. Report what ran and what did not.
