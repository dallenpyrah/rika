# Persistence Package

## Purpose

`packages/persistence/` owns Drizzle-backed local SQLite adapters, migrations, and durable storage services. It is the only package where raw Drizzle and `bun:sqlite` handles are allowed.

## Current Standards

- Keep Drizzle schema field names snake_case so column names do not need string remapping.
- Expose persistence behavior through Effect services and layers.
- Prefer `Database.memoryLayer` in tests; use file-backed `layerFromPath` only when testing file-specific SQLite behavior.
- Generated SQL migrations in `drizzle/` are committed. Do not hand-edit Drizzle metadata unless repairing a broken migration intentionally.
- Raw Drizzle handles may be used only inside this package.
- `ThreadEventLog` is canonical. `ThreadProjection` tables are disposable and must rebuild from `thread_events` only.

## For AI Agents

- Read `../../docs/persistence.md` before changing schema, migrations, or persistence services.
- Read `../../docs/effect-module-conventions.md` before adding a new persistence service.
- Keep repository/domain services above this adapter boundary so future remote storage can swap in without UI or actor changes.

## Testing And Verification

- `bun run db:generate` from this package or from the repo root after schema changes.
- `bun run db:migrate` from this package or from the repo root to apply committed migrations locally.
- `bun run lint` from this package or `bun run lint` from the repo root.
- `bun run typecheck` from this package or `bun run typecheck` from the repo root.
- `bun run test` from this package or `bun run test` from the repo root.
