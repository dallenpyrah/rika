      Set log level (parent, children, category, sinks, parentSinks, filters, lowestLevel, contextLocalStorage)
  --log-file <value>
      Set log file location (overrides the default location ${homeDir}/.cache/amp/logs/cli.log)
  --ide
      Enable IDE connection (default). When enabled, Amp automatically includes your open IDE's file and text selection
      with every message.
  --no-ide
      Disable IDE connection
  --mcp-config <value>
      JSON configuration or file path for MCP servers to merge with existing settings
  -m, --mode <value>
      Set the agent mode (rush, smart, deep1, deep2, deep3) — controls the model, system prompt, and tool selection
  --effort <value>
      Set reasoning effort for the new thread, when supported by the selected mode
  -x, --execute [message]
      Use execute mode, optionally with user message. In execute mode, agent will execute provided prompt (either as
      argument, or via stdin). Execute mode is only enabled when explicitly requested.
  --stream-json
      When used with --execute, output Rika Event schema JSON lines.
  --stream-json-thinking
      Include thinking blocks in stream JSON output (non-Claude Code extension). Implies --stream-json.
  --stream-json-input
      Read JSON Lines user messages from stdin. Requires both --execute and --stream-json.
  --no-archive-after-execute
      When used with --execute on a new thread or with the review command, leave the thread unarchived after the command
      finishes.
  -l, --label <label>
      Add a label to the thread created or continued by this command. Repeat the flag for multiple labels.

Environment variables:

  AMP_API_KEY        Access token for Amp (see https://ampcode.com/settings)
  AMP_URL            URL for the Amp service (default is https://ampcode.com/)
  AMP_LOG_LEVEL      Set log level (can also use --log-level)
  AMP_LOG_FILE       Set log file location (can also use --log-file)
  AMP_SETTINGS_FILE  Set settings file path (can also use --settings-file, default:
                     ${homeDir}/.config/amp/settings.json)

Examples:

Start an interactive session:

  $ amp

Start an interactive session with a user message:

  $ echo "commit all my unstaged changes" | amp

Use execute mode (--execute or -x) to send a command to an agent, stream Rika Event JSON lines, and then exit:

  $ amp -x "what file in this folder is in markdown format?" --stream-json | jq -r 'select(.type=="message.added" and .data.message.role=="assistant") | .data.message.content[] | select(.type=="text") | .text'

Stream the first protocol event as JSON:

  $ amp -x "2+2?" --stream-json | head -1 | jq .

Feed JSON Lines user messages through stdin:

  $ printf '%s\n' '{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"hello"}]}}' | amp -x --stream-json --stream-json-input

Pipe data to the agent and send along a prompt in execute mode:

  $ cat ~/.zshrc | amp -x "what does the 'beautiful' function do?"
  The \`beautiful\` function creates an infinite loop that prints the letter "o" in cycling colors every 0.2 seconds.

Execute a prompt from a file with explicit execute mode:

  $ amp -x < prompt.txt

Add an MCP server with a local command:

  $ amp mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp

Add an MCP server with environment variables:

  $ amp mcp add postgres --env PGUSER=orb -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres postgresql://localhost/orbing

Add a remote MCP server:

  $ amp mcp add hugging-face https://huggingface.co/mcp

Configuration:

Amp can be configured using a JSON settings file located at ${homeDir}/.config/amp/settings.json. All settings use the "amp." prefix.

Settings reference:

  amp.dangerouslyAllowAll
      Disable all command confirmation prompts (agent will execute all commands without asking)
  amp.defaultVisibility
      Define default thread visibility per repository origin using mappings like "github.com/org/repo": "workspace".
      Values: private, workspace, group.
  amp.experimental.modes
      Enable experimental agent modes by name. Available modes: deep1, deep2, deep3
  amp.fuzzy.alwaysIncludePaths
      Glob patterns for paths that should always be included in fuzzy file search, even if gitignored
  amp.git.commit.ampThread.enabled
      Enable adding Amp-Thread trailer in git commits
  amp.git.commit.coauthor.enabled
      Enable adding Amp as co-author in git commits
  amp.guardedFiles.allowlist
      Array of file glob patterns that are allowed to be accessed without confirmation. Takes precedence over the
      built-in denylist.
  amp.keymap
      Command shortcuts keyed by command ID. Values can be a shortcut string, an array of shortcuts, or null. User
      keymap entries override workspace entries. Run "amp config keymap" to list all command IDs, descriptions, and
      effective keys, with null for unbound commands.
  amp.mcpServers
      Model Context Protocol servers to connect to for additional tools
  amp.network.timeout
      How many seconds to wait for network requests to the Amp server before timing out
  amp.notifications.enabled
      Enable notification alerts when the agent completes tasks. Over SSH, or when AMP_FORCE_BEL is set, this sends a
      terminal bell.
  amp.notifications.system.enabled
      Enable system notifications when terminal is not focused
  amp.permissions
      Permission rules for tool calls. See amp permissions --help
  amp.proxy
      Proxy URL used for both HTTP and HTTPS requests to the Amp server
  amp.showCosts
      Set to false to hide costs while working on a thread
  amp.skills.disableClaudeCodeSkills
      Disable loading skills from Claude Code directories (.claude/skills/, ~/.claude/skills/,
      ~/.claude/plugins/cache/). Amp-native skill directories are not affected.
  amp.skills.path
      Path to additional directories containing skills. Supports colon-separated paths (semicolon on Windows). Use ~ for
      home directory.
  amp.terminal.animation
      Set to false to disable terminal animations (or use the equivalent NO_ANIMATION=1 env var)
  amp.terminal.copyOnSelect
      Automatically copy selection to clipboard.
  amp.terminal.detailsExpandedByDefault
      Expand thinking and tool call details by default in the CLI transcript.
  amp.tools.disable
      Array of tool names to disable. Use 'builtin:toolname' to disable only the builtin tool with that name (allowing
      an MCP server to provide a tool by that name).
  amp.tools.enable
      Array of tool name patterns to enable. Supports glob patterns (e.g., 'mcp__metabase__*'). If not set, all tools
      are enabled. If set, only matching tools are enabled.
  amp.updates.mode
      Control update checking behavior: "warn" shows update notifications, "disabled" turns off checking, "auto"
      automatically runs update.
