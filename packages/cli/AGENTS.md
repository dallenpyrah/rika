# CLI Package

## Purpose

`packages/cli/` owns Rika's command-line process entrypoint. It parses process arguments, routes no-arg interactive sessions to `@rika/tui`, runs non-interactive turns for automation, and preserves newline-delimited protocol events on stdout for execute mode.

## Key Files

| File                   | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/args.ts`          | Pure argument parser for interactive and execute/run modes. |
| `src/execute.ts`       | Effect service that runs one command and streams NDJSON.    |
| `src/mcp.ts`           | CLI MCP server list/approval command executor.              |
| `src/output.ts`        | Swappable stdout/stderr boundary for process and tests.     |
| `src/runtime.ts`       | Live layer assembly and routing for the Bun CLI process.    |
| `src/skills.ts`        | CLI skill list/inspect command executor.                    |
| `src/threads.ts`       | CLI thread lifecycle/search/share command executor.         |
| `src/main.ts`          | `rika` binary entrypoint.                                   |
| `test/args.test.ts`    | Effect CLI parser contract tests.                           |
| `test/execute.test.ts` | Fake model smoke tests for streaming JSON and diagnostics.  |
| `test/mcp.test.ts`     | MCP list/approval command output tests.                     |
| `test/skills.test.ts`  | Skill command output tests over fake skill registries.      |
| `test/threads.test.ts` | Thread command output tests over memory persistence.        |

## Current Standards

- Stdout is reserved for newline-delimited JSON protocol events; diagnostics go to stderr.
- CLI orchestration depends on `AgentLoop.Service` and `Session.Service`; provider SDKs, Drizzle, terminal I/O, and filesystem details stay behind layers.
- Tests use fake model/tool layers and memory output, not process stdout or network providers.

## For AI Agents

- Read `../../docs/effect-module-conventions.md` before adding or changing CLI services.
- Keep interactive rendering in `@rika/tui`; this package should only parse, route, and compose live layers.

## Testing And Verification

- `bun run lint` from this package or from the repo root.
- `bun run typecheck` from this package or from the repo root.
- `bun run test` from this package or from the repo root.
