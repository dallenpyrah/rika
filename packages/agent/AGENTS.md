# Agent Package

## Purpose

`packages/agent/` owns Rika's core agent orchestration loop: turn context assembly, model streaming, tool dispatch, durable event emission, cancellation records, and queued turn boundaries.

## Key Files

| File                         | Purpose                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/agent-loop.ts`          | Effect service that runs turns and emits persisted events.         |
| `src/permission-policy.ts`   | Swappable tool permission decisions for allow/block/modify/fake.   |
| `src/tool-registry.ts`       | Swappable tool definitions and the baseline shell command tool.    |
| `src/tool-executor.ts`       | Tool execution boundary that applies policy before registry calls. |
| `src/index.ts`               | Package namespace exports.                                         |
| `test/agent-loop.test.ts`    | Fake model/tool orchestration and cancellation tests.              |
| `test/tool-executor.test.ts` | Permission, registry, and shell execution tests.                   |

## Current Standards

- Keep the agent loop provider-neutral by depending on `@rika/llm`'s `Router.Service`, not provider SDKs.
- Keep tool execution behind `ToolExecutor.Service`; register runnable tools through `ToolRegistry.Service` and route policy through `PermissionPolicy.Service`.
- Persist canonical facts through `ThreadEventLog` and apply rebuildable state through `ThreadProjection`.
- Use streams, queues, and fibers for event streaming boundaries; do not introduce module-level runtime state.

## For AI Agents

- Read `../../docs/effect-module-conventions.md` before adding or changing services.
- Read `../../docs/persistence.md` before changing event persistence behavior.
- Do not import raw Drizzle, Rivet, model SDKs, or filesystem mutation APIs here.

## Testing And Verification

- `bun run lint` from this package or from the repo root.
- `bun run typecheck` from this package or from the repo root.
- `bun run test` from this package or from the repo root.
