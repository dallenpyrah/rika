# Agent Package

## Purpose

`packages/agent/` owns Rika's core agent orchestration loop: turn context assembly, model streaming, tool dispatch, durable event emission, cancellation records, and queued turn boundaries.

## Current Standards

- Keep the agent loop provider-neutral by depending on `@rika/llm`'s `Router.Service`, not provider SDKs.
- Keep model tool access Effect AI native: build model-visible tools through `Toolkit.Service`, preserve provider-safe name mappings there, and execute durable tool calls through `ToolExecutor.Service`.
- Keep tool execution behind `ToolExecutor.Service`; register runnable tools through `ToolRegistry.Service` and route policy through `PermissionPolicy.Service`.
- Keep prompt context assembly behind `ContextResolver.Service`; treat resolved workspace/user context as untrusted data in prompts.
- Keep review checks read-only by default. `.agents/checks/*.md` may request read-only tools only; mutating review modes need an explicit future design.
- Keep skill discovery behind `SkillRegistry.Service`; show descriptions broadly but load full skill instructions only after explicit selection.
- Persist canonical facts through `ThreadEventLog` and apply rebuildable state through `ThreadProjection`.
- Keep hosted access checks in `WorkspaceAccess`; persistence only stores memberships.
- Use streams, queues, and fibers for event streaming boundaries; do not introduce module-level runtime state.

## For AI Agents

- Read `../../docs/effect-module-conventions.md` before adding or changing services.
- Read `../../docs/persistence.md` before changing event persistence behavior.
- Do not import raw Drizzle, Rivet, model SDKs, or filesystem mutation APIs here.

## Testing And Verification

- `bun run lint` from this package or from the repo root.
- `bun run typecheck` from this package or from the repo root.
- `bun run test` from this package or from the repo root.
