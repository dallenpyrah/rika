# Rika Specification

Read `CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the owning feature branch before implementation.

## Feature Ledger

`docs/features/FEATURES.md` is the canonical implementation ledger. ADRs explain why architecture choices were made; the feature ledger records what the product does, where it is specified, its implementation status, and the evidence proving it.

## Decisions

| Decision                               | ADR                                                            |

## Stop Gates

- No public feature exists without a feature-ledger row and owning spec.
- No stable architectural choice exists without an ADR.
- No framework source is copied into Rika.
- No Relay or Baton internal import is introduced to bypass a missing export.
- No command parses raw process arguments.
- No process transport uses SSE.
- No semantic search or ast-grep outline product tool is introduced.
