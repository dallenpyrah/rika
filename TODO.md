- [x] Verify keymap coverage.
- [x] Restore visible file mention completion, Ctrl+S route selection, and shortcuts help with packaged interaction evidence.
- [x] Verify thread lifecycle coverage.

- [x] Verify execute and JSONL modes. Packaged plain-text and streaming JSON output flows pass against the extracted artifact; local stream-input tests prove ordered string/prompt-object JSONL and malformed-input rejection. Plain stdin prompting and image JSONL remain pending.
- [x] Verify review command and JSON output. Packaged text and JSON review flows pass against the extracted artifact.
- [x] Verify automatic compaction.
- [x] Verify cost and context displays.

- [x] Implement parallel Task runs.
- [x] Implement automatic subagent runs.
- [x] Expose model-facing subagent spawn tools on the parent agent. Enabled Relay `spawn_child_run` plus per-profile `transfer_to_*` handoff tools on the top-level agent only; native turn proves durable Oracle spawn and parent resume on 2026-07-11.

- [x] Implement parent-child event projection.
- [x] Implement child cancellation.
- [x] Implement parent cancellation.

- [x] Prove no duplicate visible side effects. The process-death harness verifies unique child projections and one visible effect per fan-out child after recovery.
- [ ] Run the multi-agent oracle review.

## Phase 10: Dynamic Workflows

- [x] Specify versioned workflow definitions.
- [x] Specify sequence operation.
- [x] Specify parallel operation.

- [x] Specify durable join policies.
- [x] Specify approval and timer waits.

- [x] Implement the closed typed dynamic workflow extension, including tool execution and structured completion operations.
- [x] Implement investigate/implement/review/fix/verify workflow.
- [x] Implement parallel research/synthesis workflow.

- [ ] Run the workflow oracle review.
  - [x] Expose only delivery and research-synthesis through typed CLI start/inspect operations; narrow generic approval and branch claims.

## Phase 11: Packaging and Final Verification

- [x] Package macOS arm64. Archive checksum, inventory, clean-home install, and local runtime verified on 2026-07-10.
- [x] Package macOS x64. Archive checksum and inventory verified on 2026-07-10; native runtime remains a release-proof CI requirement.
- [x] Package Linux x64. Archive checksum and inventory verified on 2026-07-10; native runtime remains a release-proof CI requirement.
- [x] Package Linux arm64. Archive checksum and inventory verified on 2026-07-10; native runtime remains a release-proof CI requirement.
- [x] Exclude Windows explicitly until OpenTUI support is proven. Packaging rejects Windows and the construction test prevents support claims.
- [x] Install the host archive into a clean temporary home and remove it after verification.
- [x] Install and uninstall the host archive in user-local paths with an owned command symlink. Isolated packaging coverage verifies PATH-name version, help, noninteractive execution, reinstall, foreign-command protection, and idempotent uninstall without touching user state or configuration.
- [x] Run a real packaged coding flow against a fixture repository through Baton's TestModel.
- [x] Run all repository gates after establishing the first-party coverage floor.
- [x] Run all process-death durability flows. Packaged SIGINT/SIGTERM, process reopen, cancellation, idempotent start, cursor replay, active-child recovery, and delivery/research workflow-boundary SIGKILL recovery pass.
- [x] Run all currently implemented visual parity flows through the native OpenTUI renderer and frozen screenshot/character-frame baselines.
- [x] Replace monochrome visual PPM evidence with deterministic OpenTUI foreground/background captures and frozen cell-style JSON; add synthetic scenarios for Markdown, complex diffs, tool states, queue, permission, thread/sidebar, and narrow overlays without claiming external parity.
- [x] Reach and maintain at least 95% statements, branches, functions, and lines coverage over first-party app and package source. Latest retained global report: 98.17% statements, 95.77% branches, 96.20% functions, and 98.41% lines.
- [x] Build packaged CLI E2E tests for help, parsing, execute, JSONL, threads, tools, extensions, failures, signals, and restart. Verified from the extracted release artifact with isolated temporary homes/workspaces on 2026-07-10; help/parser failures also prove Relay infrastructure is not started.
- [x] Build real OpenTUI E2E tests that drive the native renderer through keyboard input, resize, streaming, overlays, queueing, interruption, and teardown. Native renderer coverage remains in `packages/tui/test/*.native.test.ts`; a packaged native-PTY E2E additionally proves welcome/composer rendering, keyboard submission, SIGINT exit, terminal-mode activation sequences, and restored termios state on macOS arm64.
- [x] Build deterministic fake-model harness scenarios for text streaming, reasoning, tool calls, malformed calls, approvals, steering, retries, compaction, and budgets.
  - Verified with real Baton TestModel and Relay SQLite on 2026-07-11: grouped text streaming and usage replay, distinct reasoning projection/replay through Baton aaba07e, read-file tool execution, unknown and malformed tool rejection, active-execution steering accepted and injected exactly once into the next eligible model request through Relay adc73d4 plus the issue #126 correction, transient model retry, token-budget exhaustion before a second request, cancellation, idempotent start, cursor replay, Approved/Denied/Always permission restart, forced automatic compaction, one durable checkpoint across backend reopen, compacted next-request context, and context-budget projection.
- [x] Build deterministic fake-model multi-agent scenarios for parallel children, partial failure, joins, cancellation, and parent resume. The Rika-level public-API harness covers bounded parallel dispatch, all four join policies, partial failures, idempotent cancellation, SIGKILL/restart recovery, parent inspection resume, ordered projection, and visible-effect deduplication.
- [x] Build deterministic fake-model long-workflow scenarios with kill/restart injection at every implemented durable boundary. Native Relay SQLite SIGKILL harnesses pass for delivery and research-synthesis child-handler boundaries with pinned definitions and deduplicated visible effects; approval/timer waits remain outside this claim.
- [ ] Build opt-in live-model smoke and eval suites using the local Vibe proxy Effect Config.
- [ ] Capture redacted transcripts and tool-call evidence for the pending live agent suite. Packaged config/keymap/doctor tests already prove configured secrets are not disclosed, but no live-model evidence is claimed.
- [x] Confirm excluded dependencies and features are absent from release archive inventories and packaged tool/UI surfaces.
- [ ] Run repeated final oracle reviews until no critical/high findings remain.
- [x] Record local residual risks and release evidence in `docs/reference/RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md`; publication and native-host CI release evidence remain out of scope.

PLEASE MAKE SURE AT THE END YOU PUBLISH CHANGES TO BATON AND RELAY, INSTALL RIKA TO MY MACHINE, AND MAKE SURE THEY DEPEND ON PUBLISHED PACKAGES THE LINK IS/WAS ONLY FOR DEV.

## Remaining Unchecked by Phase
